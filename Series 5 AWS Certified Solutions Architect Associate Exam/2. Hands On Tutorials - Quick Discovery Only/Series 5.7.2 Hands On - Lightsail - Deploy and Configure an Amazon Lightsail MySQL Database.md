> Amazon says: You will deploy a database on Amazon Lightsail, which can be used by any Lightsail instances or applications deployed in the same AWS Region. This allows you to build applications and systems within Lightsail without needing to use additional AWS services. The tutorial will also help you add databases to a single instance, add users, create snapshots of your data, and understand how to view database metrics.

Be a Better dev says: Amazon Lightsail is an AWS service that offers pre-packaged tech stacks. You can use Lightsail to host a Wordpress site, a static website, a MEAN or LAMP stack, a database, and many other options.
