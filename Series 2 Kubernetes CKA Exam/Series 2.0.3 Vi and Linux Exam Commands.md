      NOTE: An inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as ext3 or ext4. storing the properties of a file and directories.       Linux extended filesystems such as ext3 or ext4 maintain an array of these inodes called the inode table.
      Can be an weird issues if plenty of disk space but not enough inodes to create a new file!

# Linux Folder and Files Permissions (Absolute mode)

      e.g. chmod 775 testfile.txt
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Each number has meaning in permission. Do not give full permission of 777.
      N   Description                      		ls   		binary    
      0   No permissions at all            		---  		000
      1   Only execute                     		--x  		001
      2   Only write                       		-w-  		010

# Linux Folder and Files Permissions (Symbolic Mode)

      r Permission Read 
      w Permission Write 
      x Permission Execute 
      l Permission Mandatory locking, setgid bit is on, group execution bit is off
      s Permission setuid or setgid bit is on
      S Permission suid bit is on, user execution bit is off

      NOTE:
      An Layer 4 load balancer works at the transport layer, using the TCP and UDP protocols to manage transaction traffic based on a simple load balancing algorithm and basic information such as server connections and response times. 
      An Layer 7 load balancer works at the application layer‚Äîthe highest layer in the OSI model‚Äîand makes its routing decisions based on more detailed information such as the characteristics of the HTTP/HTTPS header, message content, URL type, and cookie data. An L4-7 load balancer manages traffic based on a set of network services across ISO layers 4 through 7 that provide data storage, manipulation, and communication services.

# Vi Editor Commands
## (Most Say Not Required Now But Still Good for Working Solutions Practice)

      # We will use visual line mode
      Step 1: Move your cursor to the top line of the block of text/code to remove.
      Step 2: Press V (Shift + v) to enter the Visual mode in Vim/Vi.
      Step 3: Now move your cursor down to the bottom of the block of text/code to remove
      Step 4: Press 3d to delete the block selected.
      You can also use the gv command to rehighlight the same block again.

      # Vi How to Indent/Detent Spec Files
      :set shiftwidth=2
      Place cursor to start of line
      Press Shift V to go to Visual Line mode
      Press Up or Down to select the lines
      Press Shift . to Indent to the right
      Press Shift , to Indent to the Left

      # Vi Configure for tabstop and expandtab
      vi ~/.vimrc
      then add these two lines to the file
      set tabstop=2
      set expandtab # use spaces for tabs

      # Vi Configure for :retab
      In situations where an errant tab makes its way into your yaml file, use :retab, which replaces all tab sequences with new strings of white-space using the tabstop value.

      # Vi Configure for :set paste
      Use to keep the formatting in yaml after paste
