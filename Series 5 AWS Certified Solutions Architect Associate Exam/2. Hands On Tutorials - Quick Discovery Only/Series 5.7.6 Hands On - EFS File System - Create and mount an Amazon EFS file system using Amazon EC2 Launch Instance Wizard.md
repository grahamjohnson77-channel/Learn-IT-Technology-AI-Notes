> Amazon says: In this tutorial, you learn how to mount an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance using the EC2 Launch Instance Wizard. The Launch Instance Wizard specifies all the launch parameters required for launching an instance. Where the launch instance wizard provides a default value, you can accept the default or specify your own value. This integration simplifies and eases the process of mounting Amazon EFS file systems to Amazon EC2 instances at launch time with recommended mount options.

In this tutorial, you first create a new file system, then mount it to a new EC2 instance at the launch using the wizard, verify that file system is mounted on the EC2 instance, and then delete resources created in this tutorial. To learn more, see the Launch Instance Wizard documentation and the Amazon EFS documentation.
