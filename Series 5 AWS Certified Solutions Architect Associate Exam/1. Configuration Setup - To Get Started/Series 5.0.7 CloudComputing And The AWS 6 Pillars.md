# What is the Cloud and Why Study It?
AWS refers to Cloud Computing as: 
"Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
    Agility - Innovate & build faster
    Elasticity - Provision amount of resources you actually need
    Cost savings - Only pay for IT as you consume it
    Deploy globally in Minutes - Expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes

## Types of Cloud Computing
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT
    Platform as a Service (PaaS) - No managing underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems)
    Software as a Service (SaaS) - Provides complete product that is run and managed by the service provider
