    # Exam tip
    Use aliases all of the time
    alias k=kubectl
    e.g. k get pods
    alias kgp='k get po'
    e.g. kgp
    alias kx='kubectl explain'
    kx pods --recursive | less
    kx pods --recursive | less | grep volumes -A 5 -B 10                                    # grep for lines before/after keyword
    
    # Exam tip
    export dr="--dry-run=client -o yaml" && echo $dr                                        # show the command
    e.g. k run nginx --image=nginx $dr > pod.yaml
    --dry-run=client -o yaml is used to get the yaml output of the dry-run command.
    This is useful to see what the command will do without actually running it.

    # Exam tip

    k expose -h
    k scale -h

    OR
    Then use 'kubectl exec busybox -- CMD HERE!' to just run a command
    NOTE: This type will exist after and not delete itself!
